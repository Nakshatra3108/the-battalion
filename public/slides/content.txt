SLIDE 1: MISSION BRIEFING
================================================================================

                           ⚔️ THE BATTALION ⚔️
                    Tactical Dominance Simulation

OBJECTIVE:
Secure the most **LOCKED** Control Battalions by the end of the operation.

HOW TO WIN:
1. **CONTROL** a Sector by occupying >50% of its slots.
2. The units used to secure control become **LOCKED**.
3. **LOCKED UNITS = POINTS** (1 Point each).

⚠️ CRITICAL DISTINCTION:
You do NOT win by controlling the most Sectors.
You win by having the most locked units in them!
A large sector (11 pts) is worth nearly 2x a corner sector (6 pts).

SLIDE 2: THE BATTLEFIELD
================================================================================

                           🗺️ THE BATTLEFIELD 🗺️

3x3 Grid of Sectors. Each type requires a different force to CONTROL.

SECTOR BREAKDOWN:
• **LARGE** (N/S Citadel)     : 21 Slots → Need **11** to Control.
• **EDGES** (E/W Gate)        : 17 Slots → Need **9** to Control.
• **CORNERS** (The Reach)     : 11 Slots → Need **6** to Control.
• **CENTER** (The Nexus)      : 9 Slots  → Need **5** to Control.

⚡ HOT ZONES:
Red slots marked with lighting bolts.
• Placing here TRIGGERS a Flashpoint Event card.
• The unit becomes PERMANENT (cannot be moved or converted).

SLIDE 3: CONTROL & LOCKING MECHANICS
================================================================================

                      🔒 CORE MECHANIC: LOCKING 🔒

This is the most important rule in the game!

1. FORMING CONTROL:
   As soon as you reach the required number (e.g., 6 in a Corner), 
   those 6 battalions become **LOCKED**.

2. LOCKED STATUS:
   • Locked units CANNOT be moved (Redeployed).
   • Locked units CANNOT be converted by enemies (mostly).
   • Locked units COUNT for your score.

3. UNLOCKED UNITS:
   Any units *above* the requirement remain Unlocked.
   • Unlocked units CAN be moved to other sectors.
   • Unlocked units protect your Control against removal.

SLIDE 7: REDEPLOYMENT RULES
================================================================================

                         ↔️ REDEPLOYMENT ↔️

This is how you expand without spending money.

RULE 1: WHO CAN MOVE?
You can only move units OUT of a sector if you **CONTROL** it (>50%).
*(Having 3 units vs enemy's 2 is NOT enough! You need 6+ in a corner).*

RULE 2: WHAT CAN MOVE?
You can only move **UNLOCKED** units.
The units securing your control are stuck guarding it.

RULE 3: WHERE?
To any **ADJACENT** sector (connected by lines).

RULE 4: WHOSE UNITS?
You can move **ANY** unlocked unit - even enemies!
*Tactic: Force enemy units out of your sector into a useless one!*

================================================================================

                          🏆 VICTORY & STRATEGY 🏆

GAME OVER:
• All 9 Sectors Controlled.
• Map Full (Total Gridlock).

SCORING:
• 1 Locked Unit = 1 Point.

WINNING TIPS:
★ **Defense First:** Unlocked units are your shield. Don't leave your locked core exposed to "Tough Love".
★ **Map Awareness:** Don't fight for a lost sector. Pivot to an empty one.
★ **Black Ops:** Save "Veto" cards to stop enemies from moving your units.
★ **Hot Zones:** Use them to secure a permanent spot, but beware the random Flashpoint events!
