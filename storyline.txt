THE BATTALION: OPERATIONAL MASTER GUIDE (COMPLETE EDITION)
================================================================================
"Peace is not a condition; it is a victory."

This document is the absolute authority on how to play "The Battalion".
It assumes ZERO prior knowledge. Read it from top to bottom to master the game.

================================================================================
SECTION 1: THE GOAL (HOW TO WIN)
================================================================================

Most strategy games are about "Occupying Territory".
This game is different. This game is about **LOCKING** territory.

THE OBJECTIVE:
At the end of the game, players count their **LOCKED BATTALIONS**.
- 1 Locked Battalion = 1 Point.
- The player with the MOST points wins.

WHAT IS A "LOCKED" BATTALION?
When you deploy enough troops into a Sector to secure it (>50% capacity), your units turn into STATUES (Locked).
- They gain a padlock icon.
- They cannot be moved.
- They are your permanent score.
- **Example:** If you secure a sector that needs 6 units, you get 6 POINTS.

GAME OVER TRIGGERS:
The game ends immediately when:
1. All 9 Sectors are Controlled (have a owner).
2. OR The map is completely full (no empty slots left).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

================================================================================
SECTION 2: THE MAP & MATH
================================================================================

The map is a 3x3 grid (9 Sectors total).
Each sector has a different SIZE. Size matters because bigger sectors give more points!

THE 4 SECTOR TYPES:

1. CORNERS (4 Sectors) - "The Race"
   - Name: Frozen Reach, Storm Peak, Dead Drop, Ember Coast.
   - Total Slots: 11
   - **CONTROL REQUIREMENT: 6 Units**
   - Value: 6 Points.
   - Strategy: Easy to secure. Go here first!

2. EDGES (2 Sectors) - "The Bridge"
   - Name: Iron Gate, Shadow Pass.
   - Total Slots: 17
   - **CONTROL REQUIREMENT: 9 Units**
   - Value: 9 Points.
   - Strategy: Harder to fill, but good for moving troops between corners.

3. CENTER (1 Sector) - "The Nexus"
   - Name: The Nexus.
   - Total Slots: 9
   - **CONTROL REQUIREMENT: 5 Units**
   - Value: 5 Points.
   - Strategy: Connects to everything, but low score value.

4. CITADELS (2 Sectors) - "The Jackpots"
   - Name: Northern Citadel, Southern Bastion.
   - Total Slots: 21
   - **CONTROL REQUIREMENT: 11 Units**
   - Value: 11 Points.
   - Strategy: Massive score boost. Securing one of these is worth almost TWO corners.

HOT ZONES (!):
Some slots have a RED EXCLAIMATION MARK status.
- **Rule 1:** Placing a unit here triggers a Random Event Card (Flashpoint).
- **Rule 2:** Units here became PERMANENT. They can never move.
- **Rule 3:** They check for "Control" just like normal units.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

================================================================================
SECTION 3: RESOURCES (MONEY)
================================================================================

You have 4 types of currency. You can hold a MAXIMUM of 12 Total Resources.
Any excess resources are lost immediately!

1. 🟢 SUPPLY    : Used for purchasing units (Economy).
2. 🔴 FIREPOWER : Used for attacking enemies (Force).
3. 🔵 INTEL     : Used for spying and speed (Information).
4. 🟡 MORALE    : Used for defense and conversion (Loyalty).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

================================================================================
SECTION 4: TURN SEQUENCE (STEP-BY-STEP)
================================================================================

GAME START:
Players are assigned by voting.
- Player 1 starts with 4 Resources.
- Player 2 starts with 5 Resources.
- Player 3 starts with 6 Resources.
- Player 4 starts with 7 Resources.
- Player 5 starts with 8 Resources.
- (Giving later players a slight resource handicap and early players position handicap).

ON YOUR TURN, YOU DO THESE 4 STEPS IN ORDER:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 1: SITUATION REPORT (GETTING PAID)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A card appears with a story dilemma and 2 choices (Can be of any of the 4 Commanders).
- Pick one choice.
- **Gain Resources:** You get the resources shown on the card (usually 2-4).
- **Gain XP:** You level up the Commander associated with that color.

*The "Spin" Mechanic:*
Hate the options? You can pay 4 RESOURCES to discard the card and draw a new one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2: ACTION PHASE (SPENDING MONEY)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the main phase. You can do as many actions as you can afford.

ACTION A: REQUISITION (BUYING UNITS)
Buy "Deployment Orders" from the shop.
- **1 Battalion** : Costs ~2 Resources.
- **2 Battalions**: Costs ~4 Resources.
- **3 Battalions**: Costs ~6 Resources.
*Tip: Buying large batches is slightly more efficient.*

ACTION B: BLACK OPS (BUYING CARDS)
- Pay Resources to buy a "Black Ops Card".

ACTION C: PLAY CARDS
- Play a Black Ops card from your hand.

ACTION D: USE COMMANDER POWERS
- If you have unlocked Level 3 or 5 powers of any Commander, click them to use them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 3: DEPLOYMENT (PLACING UNITS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You MUST place all the units you just bought.
- Click any EMPTY slot on the map.
- If you click a HOT ZONE (!), a Flashpoint event happens immediately (read the popup!).

*Core Rule: You cannot end your turn with units still in reserve.*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 4: REDEPLOYMENT (MOVING UNITS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can move units around the map for free. BUT there are strict rules.

**THE 4 RULES OF MOVEMENT:**
1. **The "Majority" Rule:** You can only move units OUT of a sector if you CONTROL it (>50% occupancy).
   - If you have 5 units in a Corner (Total 11), you CANNOT move. You need 6.
   - If you are Tied (e.g., you have 4, Enemy has 4), NO ONE can move.

2. **The "Unlocked" Rule:** You can only move EXTRA units.
   - If a Corner needs 6 to control, and you have 8 units there...
   - The first 6 are LOCKED (Statues). They stay to hold the point.
   - The extra 2 are UNLOCKED. You can move these 2.

3. **The "Adjacency" Rule:** You can only move to a neighbor sector.

4. **The "Hostile" Rule:** You can move ANY Unlocked unit. Even enemy units!
   - Use this to kick enemy squatters out of your territory!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 5: THE COMMANDERS (YOUR POWERS)

================================================================================
SECTION 7: User Interface
================================================================================

The Battalion uses a retro-futuristic military terminal interface, blending cold-war command aesthetics with modern grid-logic clarity. The entire game’s visual theme is built around the following core pillars:

Primary Color:
Neon Tactical Green (#00FF6A)
Used for all UI lines, sector borders, buttons, and system text.

Secondary Colors:

Warning Red (#FF3B30) → Alerts, hot zones, errors, destruction indicators and Black Ops.

Fire Red → Hardliner-related and Firepower.

Natural Green → Contractor-related and supply.

Signal Blue (#5AB4FF) → Intel-related UI, network status, agent highlights.

Support Yellow (#FFC734) → Morale indicators, diplomacy and soft actions.

Ambient Black (#000000) → Background and negative space.

This color hierarchy ensures that players can instantly identify threat, safety, interactable elements, and system responses.
