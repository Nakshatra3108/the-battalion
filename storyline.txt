THE BATTALION: OPERATIONAL MASTER GUIDE (COMPLETE EDITION)
================================================================================
"Peace is not a condition; it is a victory."

This document is the absolute authority on how to play "The Battalion".
It assumes ZERO prior knowledge. Read it from top to bottom to master the game.

================================================================================
SECTION 1: THE GOAL (HOW TO WIN)
================================================================================

Most strategy games are about "Occupying Territory".
This game is different. This game is about **LOCKING** territory.

THE OBJECTIVE:
At the end of the game, players count their **LOCKED BATTALIONS**.
- 1 Locked Battalion = 1 Point.
- The player with the MOST points wins.

WHAT IS A "LOCKED" BATTALION?
When you deploy enough troops into a Sector to secure it (>50% capacity), your units turn into STATUES (Locked).
- They gain a padlock icon.
- They cannot be moved.
- They are your permanent score.
- **Example:** If you secure a sector that needs 6 units, you get 6 POINTS.

GAME OVER TRIGGERS:
The game ends immediately when:
1. All 9 Sectors are Controlled (have a owner).
2. OR The map is completely full (no empty slots left).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

================================================================================
SECTION 2: THE MAP & MATH
================================================================================

The map is a 3x3 grid (9 Sectors total).
Each sector has a different SIZE. Size matters because bigger sectors give more points!

THE 4 SECTOR TYPES:

1. CORNERS (4 Sectors) - "The Race"
   - Name: Frozen Reach, Storm Peak, Dead Drop, Ember Coast.
   - Total Slots: 11
   - **CONTROL REQUIREMENT: 6 Units**
   - Value: 6 Points.
   - Strategy: Easy to secure. Go here first!

2. EDGES (2 Sectors) - "The Bridge"
   - Name: Iron Gate, Shadow Pass.
   - Total Slots: 17
   - **CONTROL REQUIREMENT: 9 Units**
   - Value: 9 Points.
   - Strategy: Harder to fill, but good for moving troops between corners.

3. CENTER (1 Sector) - "The Nexus"
   - Name: The Nexus.
   - Total Slots: 9
   - **CONTROL REQUIREMENT: 5 Units**
   - Value: 5 Points.
   - Strategy: Connects to everything, but low score value.

4. CITADELS (2 Sectors) - "The Jackpots"
   - Name: Northern Citadel, Southern Bastion.
   - Total Slots: 21
   - **CONTROL REQUIREMENT: 11 Units**
   - Value: 11 Points.
   - Strategy: Massive score boost. Securing one of these is worth almost TWO corners.

HOT ZONES (⚡):
Some slots have a RED LIGHTNING BOLT status.
- **Rule 1:** Placing a unit here triggers a Random Event Card (Flashpoint).
- **Rule 2:** Units here became PERMANENT. They can never move.
- **Rule 3:** They check for "Control" just like normal units.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

================================================================================
SECTION 3: RESOURCES (MONEY)
================================================================================

You have 4 types of currency. You can hold a MAXIMUM of 12 Total Resources.
Any excess resources are lost immediately!

1. 🟡 SUPPLY (Funds)    : Used for purchasing units (Economy).
2. 🔴 FIREPOWER (Clout) : Used for attacking enemies (Force).
3. 🟣 INTEL (Media)     : Used for spying and speed (Info).
4. 🔵 MORALE (Trust)    : Used for defense and conversion (Loyalty).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

================================================================================
SECTION 4: TURN SEQUENCE (STEP-BY-STEP)
================================================================================

GAME START:
Players are assigned a random turn order.
- Player 1 starts with 6 Resources.
- Player 2 starts with 7 Resources.
- (And so on... giving later players a slight resource handicap).

ON YOUR TURN, YOU DO THESE 4 STEPS IN ORDER:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 1: SITUATION REPORT (GETTING PAID)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A card appears with a story dilemma and 4 choices.
- Pick one choice.
- **Gain Resources:** You get the resources shown on the card (usually 2-4).
- **Gain XP:** You level up the Commander associated with that color.

*The "Spin" Mechanic:*
Hate the options? You can pay 4 RESOURCES to discard the card and draw a new one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2: ACTION PHASE (SPENDING MONEY)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the main phase. You can do as many actions as you can afford.

ACTION A: REQUISITION (BUYING UNITS)
Buy "Deployment Orders" from the shop.
- **1 Battalion** : Costs ~2 Resources.
- **2 Battalions**: Costs ~4 Resources.
- **3 Battalions**: Costs ~6 Resources.
*Tip: Buying large batches is slightly more efficient.*

ACTION B: BLACK OPS (BUYING CARDS)
- Pay 3 Resources (Any mix) to draw a "Conspiracy Card".
- Keep it hidden. Max hand size is 3.

ACTION C: PLAY CARDS
- Play a Black Ops card from your hand.

ACTION D: USE POWERS
- If you have unlocked Level 3 or 5 powers, click them to use them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 3: DEPLOYMENT (PLACING UNITS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You MUST place all the units you just bought.
- Click any EMPTY slot on the map.
- If you click a HOT ZONE (⚡), a Flashpoint event happens immediately (read the popup!).

*Core Rule: You cannot end your turn with units still in reserve.*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 4: REDEPLOYMENT (MOVING UNITS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can move units around the map for free. BUT there are strict rules.

**THE 4 RULES OF MOVEMENT:**
1. **The "Majority" Rule:** You can only move units OUT of a sector if you CONTROL it (>50% occupancy).
   - If you have 5 units in a Corner (Total 11), you CANNOT move. You need 6.
   - If you are Tied (e.g., you have 4, Enemy has 4), NO ONE can move.

2. **The "Unlocked" Rule:** You can only move EXTRA units.
   - If a Corner needs 6 to control, and you have 8 units there...
   - The first 6 are LOCKED (Statues). They stay to hold the point.
   - The extra 2 are UNLOCKED. You can move these 2.

3. **The "Adjacency" Rule:** You can only move to a neighbor sector connected by a line.

4. **The "Hostile" Rule:** You can move ANY Unlocked unit. Even enemy units!
   - Use this to kick enemy squatters out of your territory!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

================================================================================
SECTION 7: FAQ (FOR NEW PLAYERS)
================================================================================

Q: Can I move units out of a Hot Zone?
A: NO. Hot Zones are permanent traps. Once in, never out.

Q: Can I destroy a Locked unit?
A: YES! Warlord Level 5 (Kinetic Strike) can destroy locked units. If you do, the opponent drops below >50% and LOSES CONTROL of the sector immediately.

Q: I have 5 units in the center (Nexus). Why can't I move?
A: The Center capacity is 9. Majority is 5.
   - If you have exactly 5, they are ALL Locked (5 needed for control).
   - You need a 6th unit (5 Locked + 1 Unlocked) to start moving/redeploying.

Q: Does "Passive" bonus stack?
A: Yes. If you are Level 2 Strategist AND Level 2 Warlord, you get +1 Supply AND +1 Firepower every turn.
